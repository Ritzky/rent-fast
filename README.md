Rent-Fast:

Aims:
1. Have a working front end app which allows login/signup and different user roles
2. User roles should be: Admin/Landlord/Maintenance Worker/Tenant
3. There are several AI features such as maintenance worker match/rental price predicition/document validity/ potentially propety value predictions
4. Tenants should be able to view their documents tenancy agreements/certs etc and be able to request any maintenance through the app as well as have a messaging platform in app - these tenants can only be invited they can not sign up
5. Landlords should be able to do everything that tenants can do as well as upload documents and be able to add tenants and properties to their page - landlords have to be invited to signup by an admin
6. Maintenance workers should be able to add their profiles and skills and availability so landlords can hire them and have an accept function and provide quotes - they will have a sign up page
7. Admins should be able to remove landlords tenants and maintenance workers as well as invite either or all of the above.

The backend will be made using convex this includes auth/databases and the ai search for maintenance workers

The front end will be made using reactjs
